Accurecny (a play on _accuracy_ and _ECN_) is a tool designed to measure the adoption of Accurate ECN on the Internet.

### What is Accurate ECN?

Far be it from me to answer this question. I'll let the experts describe it:

> Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate incipient congestion to the endpoints. ... ECN was originally specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT). Recent new TCP mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx), Data Center TCP (DCTCP) or Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) need more accurate ECN feedback information whenever more than one marking is received in one RTT. This document updates the original ECN specification in RFC 3168 to specify a scheme that provides more than one feedback signal per RTT in the TCP header. [^1]

### Why Measure Its Deployment?

Even if applications are (re)designed to leverage the [soon-to-be-widespread adoption](https://corporate.comcast.com/stories/comcast-kicks-off-industrys-first-low-latency-docsis-field-trials) of low-latency connection-oriented protocols, they will not achieve the best possible performance unless the networking software on servers can provide more than one ECN marking per RTT. In other words, an application that could benefit from low-latency connections will require Accurate ECN deployment on the client and server operating systems. Having data on the availability of the deployment of Accurate ECN will build awareness about the importance of support for the protocol.

### The Data

The data available on this website provide a perspective on the deployment of Accurate ECN on the most popular websites on the Internet. Determination of what constitutes the _most popular websites on the Internet_ is made using data from [Tranco](https://tranco-list.eu/).

#### The Files

The data is available at [https://accurecny.cerfca.st/data/](https://accurecny.cerfca.st/data/). The names of the files indicate the date the data were collected: `YYYYMMDD`. The `.csv` file contains the results of determining whether each of the top 500 most popular websites support Accurate ECN. The `.log` file contains the logging output generated by the tool when collecting the data. See [below](#the-tool) for more information about the tool used to collect the data.

#### The Data Dictionary

Each of the data files is formatted as a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file. Each row in the file contains data on the status of Accurate ECN support for one of the top 500 most popular sites on the Internet. 

From left to right, the fields are:

| Field Number | Field Description | Field Type |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | The popularity rank of the site. | Unsigned Integer (in base 10) |
| 2 | The URL of the site. | String |
| 3 | The IP used to determine the status of the site's support for Accurate ECN. | String |
| 4 | Whether or not the tool successfully made a determination about the site's support for Accurate ECN. | Boolean |
| 5 | Whether the site supports Accurate ECN.[^2] | Boolean |
| 6 | The 16 bit value of the TCP flags in the SYN/ACK packet. | Unsigned 16-bit Number (in hexadecimal) |

[^2]: The value of this field will be false if the tool could not successfully make a determination about the site's support.
